Here you can find multiple projects as well as their description and a few test cases.

1. Takuzu solver
    This program's goal is to solve a sudoku-like game named Takuzu (binairo). It uses backtracking as well as a form of logic to solve it. This is limited in the size it can take due to the way that recursion depth and the stack operate. The hardest puzzle will be the last one.
    To run this, simply download the file, and run it using the GNU compiler.
